# Laser cut calipers
Laser cut vernier calipers. Achieves 0.1mm accuracy when tuned. Also includes depth rod and flush head.

File was designed with 0.135mm of kerf in mind, using 3mm cast transparent acrylic from Dama. Joined with acrylic glue.

Future improvements (pull requests welcome):
* Assembly instructions/diagram
* Dowel pin alignment (for easier assembly)
* .SVG auto generation based on kerf test results
* Cut settings
* CorelDRAW file
