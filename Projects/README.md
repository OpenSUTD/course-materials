NB: If you are using windows ang git bash, open up a terminal (powershell or cmd is fine) in with admin access and use `git config core.longpaths true` to handle long file names.
### If you are not a collaborator yet!
* If you are not a collaborator yet, it's a little more complicated:
   1. `fork` this repository by clicking the fork button above. This creates a copy of opensutd under your GitHub account
   2. `git clone https://github.com/yourgithubid/opensutd`
   3. `cd opensutd`, add the original repository as remote by running `git remote add upstream https://github.com/joel-huang/opensutd`
   4. On your local copy, either (a) copy your project folder into `/Projects`, or (b) run `git submodule add https://github.com/your/repo` from the `/Projects` directory, depending on whether your project exists as a folder on your computer or another GitHub repository
   5. `git add -A`, `git commit -m "added myprojectname"`, `git push`
   6. Now _your_ copy of opensutd is updated. Navigate to the _original_ opensutd, and click the green pull request button. You should see your fork! Submit your pull request
   7. Remember to update your fork next time you want to contribute, using `git pull upstream master` before doing anything

### If you are a collaborator!
#### 1. Uploading your folder
##### Your project is an existing Github repository
* Create a new branch on the browser `myprojectname`
* `cd` to `opensutd` on your disk
* `git pull` to get the latest version
* `git checkout myprojectname` to switch to your branch
* `cd Projects`
* `git submodule add https://github.com/you/repo`, replace with your repo
* `git add -A`, `git commit -m "added myprojectname"`, `git push myprojectname`
* Submit pull request into `master`

##### Your project resides on a folder on your computer
* Create a new branch on the browser `myprojectname`
* `cd` to `opensutd` on your disk
* `git pull` to get the latest version
* `git checkout myprojectname` to switch to your branch
* Copypasta your folder into `/Projects`
* `git add -A`, `git commit -m "added myprojectname"`, `git push myprojectname`
* Submit pull request into `master`

#### 2. Documentation
##### What's your project about?
Your folder should include a `README.md` file at the top level. For example, `opensutd/Projects/MyProjectName/README.md`. For markdown formatting help there's [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app)!
