# First-gen prototype OpenSUTD. We've created the [OpenSUTD organization](https://github.com/opensutd) - this repo has been forked there and will no longer be updated here. 
Hello there, welcome to OpenSUTD! We believe knowledge should be available for everyone who wants to access it. MIT set up OpenCourseWare in the spirit of sharing knowledge with everybody - this is our take on it, and it'll be interesting to see what this evolves into!  

> **Important note:** This is crowd-contributed stuff that's in its infancy and it'd be nice if this can be developed into a useful & valuable platform **before** it is shared around!  

> **Important note 2:** The endgame for this project is simply to be **a platform to share information**. If you are the creator or owner of any of the materials on this repository and would not like it to be here, we will take it down.

## What is this OpenSUTD?
This should be a space to encourage self-improvement and share knowledge, not spoon-feed it. What's fair game for contribution:
* Past lecture materials
* Past quiz, assignment, and homework questions
* Posters
* Project reports
* Personal notes and projects

What **shouldn't** be here:
* Quiz, examination, and homework **answers** (Tips and notes are fine)

## Contributing to OpenSUTD
**Anyone** can contribute material by submitting a issue or pull request! This prototype is still in its infancy, so we're looking for collaborators to act as content curators, who help to manage what's in the repository. In the case of legacy course materials, curators should have taken the course before.

## Repository Structure
As the repository grows, optimizing its structure lets people find what they want easily. An example would be:
```
/Courses
	/10.001 Advanced Math I
		/Summer 2017
		/Projects
		...
	...
	/50.002 Computation Structures
		/Fall 2017
		/Projects
		...
	...
/Personal Projects
	/I Made A Thing
		/src
		...
	/memes
		/2018
			is_this_loss.jpg
			...
		...		
```
File naming should be consistent across the repository. In general, stuff should be organized and easy to find:
* Courses with their code and canonical name, e.g. `10.001 Advanced Math I`
* Lecture slides should have the week number and a descriptive filename, e.g. `Week 10 - James Scott - Commentary on Jacob's work.pdf`
* Subdirectories as needed, e.g. `/Additional Readings` or `/src`
